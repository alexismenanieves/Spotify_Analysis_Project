## README

This project contains code files for creating unsupervised analysis of song similarity retrieved from Spotify. Some concepts are addressed, like EDA, clustering and dendograms. You are expected to know how to run R. Tidyverse and httr are required among other packages.

### Structure

The main files are:
- `Spotify_Analysis_Connection.R`: R script which contains functions for creating the connection to Spotify and retrieves data like artists, albums and tracks
- `Spotify_Analysis_Script`: R script that contains the data cleaning, a basic EDA and a clustering of song data, from some artists like Pearl Jam and Pedro Suarez-Vertiz
- `README.md`: A brief overview of the project
